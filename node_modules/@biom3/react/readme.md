# @biom3/react

This package publishes via CICD to the public npm component: `@biom3/react`.

## What's inside?

All react based BIOME components, hooks and utils. All components and hooks will be atleast 90% covered with tests. To read more about our API philosophy see this [document](https://immutable.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS/pages/2034341776/Proposal+BIOME+Philosophy).

To read more about this package, please goto [biome.immutable.com](https://biome.immutable.com)

## How to use

To use any `@biom3/react` primitives, install the package using your package manager of choice. For example:

```bash
npm i @biom3/react
```

and then import the primitive you need (all primitives will be exported from the root of the package):

```tsx
import { Box, IconArrowBackward } from '@biom3/react';
```

## Component maturity status

We have designed and implemented a grqanular status system where each BIOME design system component has it's own maturity status. Information on these component statuses can be found [in confluence](https://immutable.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS/pages/2034439335/Proposal+Documentation#Component-status).

Each status update should be accompanied by a timestamp (format: ddd mm yyyy, eg: '2nd Dec 2022'). We will use these timestamps to move components through the status levels, as technical debt. You can find each component's status, inside of it's readme.md file.

### Component statuses

<!-- ```diff
+ Green
- Red
! Orange
@@ Pink @@
# Gray

```diff
! alpha !
```

Early on in a component’s life, it’s status should be set to **alpha** - which gives developers using it, an indication of the component's maturity. alpha components are likely to see API changes (breaking changes will of-course be avoided - but may sometimes be necessary).

---

```diff
@@ beta @@
```

Components become **beta** when they have been used in production at least once.

---

```diff
+ stable +
```

Components will become **stable** when they have been beta for 2 months with no API changes. Stable components are fully mature, and will not have their API’s change in a breaking way (unless a new major version is released).
